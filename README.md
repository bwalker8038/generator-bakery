## Getting Started

We'll need [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io), so lets tell npm to get it:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

Yeoman has plug-ins, those are managed by npm too:

```
$ npm install -g generator-bakery
```

```
$ yo bakery
```

Ok, so we have an application, lets fire it up.  Grunt will run browserify and lint your scripts whenever they change, if your using chrome your web application will also live reload.

```
$ grunt
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
